# Image Caption Generator

A deep learning-based tool that generates descriptive captions for images using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Built with Python, TensorFlow, VGG16 for feature extraction, LSTM for text generation, and deployed via Streamlit for an interactive user interface. Trained on the Flickr8k dataset.

## Features
- **Image Feature Extraction**: Uses pre-trained VGG16 to extract visual features from images.
- **Caption Generation**: Employs an LSTM model to generate natural language descriptions.
- **Web Interface**: Allows users to upload images and view AI-generated captions via Streamlit.
- **Visualization**: Displays uploaded images alongside their captions.
